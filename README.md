## Description

This is the github repository of the **mod project** folder for my [Playable Rulers mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823002635). 
This will be the most up to date project folder from the mod, even before it's on steam.

## How to build the mod

### What you will need

- The Modbuddy SDK (Search in the steam's tool sections)
- Follow the wondeful [guide from the Xcom 2 modding subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcom2mods/wiki/firsttime#wiki_how_to_install_and_set_up_xcom_2_wotc_sdk)
- Start the SDK, go in file then "open mod project" (you will need to extract the project's folder).
- Then do your changes (DO NOT CHANGES the `XcomEditor.ini`, `XcomEngine.ini` and `XcomGame.ini` or the mod will throw in an errors. In general, don't change the content in the `.uc` file unless you know what you are doing)

### Mod used by the mod

#### Required mod

Required mod = [Mitzruti's Perk Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1561030099), [X2WOTCCommunityHighlander](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1134256495), [Custom Soldier Evac Fix](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1124713229) and [Alien Hunters Community Highlander [WOTC]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2534737016)

(The perk pack is not **required**, but a lot of ability won't work or will need new ability tree.)

Optional mod = [UFOpedia & Bestiary](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2819129273) (this mod add entry for the captured rulers. They are made by Endlesspie49).

## FAQ

### Why not post the "ready to use" version of the mod ?
Because it allows you to change the source code and compile the mod as you see fit. If enough people ask, I will release the proper mod to github as well.

### Can I do mod requests and bug reports ?
**YES**, you can. You can even make pull request if you know what you are doing.

### Can I fork it ?
Yes you can, just credit the original author (Gazgemauch) and me.
